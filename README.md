# EmployeeProjectManagementSystem

I have followed four layer Architecture. 
 1. Presenatation Layer - It contain the Api call
 2. Business Layer - it contain business logic
 3. Data Layer - it connect with the database using Entity Framework.
 4. Shared Layer - it is common on above three layer.

There is one angular project also for the frontend i.e. "Project Management" 

I have created full stack Application here using Angular as frontend and Dot Net as backend for API Calls.

For running frontend use the command "ng init" and after that use "ng serve".
for running backend , open with viusal studio and execute it.

Note: Remenber to change database connection string in backend for storing in SQL server.
